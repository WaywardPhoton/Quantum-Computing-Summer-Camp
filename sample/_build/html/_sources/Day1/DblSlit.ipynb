    "**Classical physics** is the field of physics that describes the movement of large objects, like planets and humans (and cats!). This is the field of physics that had been known to humans for a long time. However, at the start of the 20th century, classical physics was having a lot of trouble explaining the results of some puzzling experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules that applied to large objects --like Newton’s laws to humans-- did not make sense when applied to very small objects. A new theory —quantum theory— was developed to explain the behavior of quantum objects such as photons (particles of light), electrons, and other microscopic objects.\n"

    "The first experiment can be compared to Bitly standing in front of an open door: say, the front door leading to the very forbidden *outdoors*. How would it get through the door, according to the laws of classical physics? Well, chances are it'd just pass right though, straight through the doorway, and come out fully on the other side. Cats may not care much for the laws of people, but they still obey the laws of physics! Scientists wanted to see if light would move through an opening the same way a cat might cross an open doorway. \n",

    "Now, let's exapnd this to an acutal experiment that was done in physics. Replace the cat with a light bulb, and the open doorway with a piece of paper that has two small slits carved into it. Imagine a light bulb shining on two slits in a piece of paper. A black screen is placed behind the slits, so that a scientist can see where the light goes. This is called the \"double-slit\" experiment.\n",

At that time, light was thought to be composed of many small particles, called photons. Scientists thought that a given particle would go through either the left or the right slit. Since millions of these particles in a beam of light would be making this decision every second, the final result should just be two bright spots!\n",

    "How could light be both a particle and a wave? How could it behave like a particle sometimes, and a wave at others?\n",

    "\n",
    "A whole branch of physics, called **quantum mechanics**, had to be invented just to explain this! The only logical explanation is that the photon passes through **both slits** at once, then interferes with itself. This would mean that the single photon was behaving like a wave!\n",
    "This interference leads to peaks where the waves build up on each other, and troughs where the waves cancel each other out. \n",
    "This idea that the photon can be in multiple places at once is called **superposition**, and it's a very important principle in quantum physics. The interference of two waves that causes a superposition is shown below. \n",

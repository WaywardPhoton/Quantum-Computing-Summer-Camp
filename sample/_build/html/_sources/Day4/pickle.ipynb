    "Joey decides to keep one pickle for themselves, and give one to Bob, but wants to make sure both pickles are the same type before they do this - otherwise they might give themselves the Delux, and Bob the Blah! (how rude!). \n",

    "\n",
    "Joey will try to check if the pickles are the same brand using a computer. As we will see, this will let them check using just one step! Joey begins by placing pickle boxes inside their quantum computer:\n",

    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Joey's computer will now implement a special gate, which we will call the \"D\" gate. You will write the code yourself to get the DGate working. To do this, go into the [Scratch project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/414238323/).\n",
    "\n",

If we make sure to only let our qubit be in the up or down states, we are really just using a classical computer. \n",

    "This idea, of sending in superpositions of several different things we'd like to know about, is called quantum parallelism. In the questions below you'll explore what the DGate does to the right state. You'll need to remember what you learned earlier today about how gates work together with superposition: \n",

    "By editing your Scratch project, try to have one of your measurement blocks say \"same\" when the pickles are the same brand, and \"different\" when they are not. \n",

    "Our quantum solution isn't really all that much faster than opening both boxes, at least when there are just two boxes. However,  a similar approach solves a harder problem: \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have 100 boxes, and that we know for sure that either all the boxes contain the same brand of pickles, or that exactly half of the boxes contain Blah brand and half contain Delux brand. Then a quantum computer can learn which situation we are in using just one step. A classical computer would have to open at least half the boxes before being able to answer with certainty - so the quantum computer is much faster!\n",
    "\n",
    "Its important that if we asked a different question, the quantum computer actually isn't any better at solving the problem than the regular idea of opening all the boxes. For example if we don't give any guarantee about whats in the boxes, the classical computer is just as fast as the quantum one.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a general feature in quantum computing. Quantum computers are not better at all kinds of problems - they're only better at certain problems! Of course, some of these problems are quite important ones, and that means quantum computers will have a big impact. In the next section we'll learn about a few different problems where quantum approaches are useful. \n"

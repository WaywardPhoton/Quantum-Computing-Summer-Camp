## Discussion
Once you have your groups, and have decided what your topic will be, please send an email to the quantum team (quantum@geeringup.ca) to let us know what your topic will be on!

Now, navigating through this project can be a bit tough, so feel free to post questions and comments on Piazza! You can also post any suggestions or cool ideas you had, in case others might want to know.

Make a post on Piazza under the "project" folder to let us know what your team will be pitching!

    "There are many quantum objects that can be investigated to better understand their properties: we can look at photons (like in the double-slit experiment) or superconductors, or even single electrons. However, in this section we will get to explore a quantum property called **spin**. This property is used to create qubits, so it's quite important!\n",
    "\n",
    "You might remember from science classes that matter is composed of atoms, and atoms are made of positively charged protons, negatively charged electrons, and charge-less neutrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do a little thought experiment. Based on your knowledge of physics up until this point, if we shot a single neutron through a magnet, what would its trajectory be? If you don't know what will happen, take a guess! We'll walk you through the solution. \n",

    "Since the neutron is an uncharged particle, it would be expected to go straight through the magnets!\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is not what was observed. Small deflections — movements not in a straight line — were observed when a beam of neutrons was passed through these magnets. What is even more weird is that if the magnets were oriented in a different direction, the same trend in behavior was observed for the beam of particles. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the neutron is uncharged, the deflection had to be coming from the particle's magnetic moment (its tendency to align with a magnetic field), and so physicists had to come up with a new property to explain this behaviour, called **spin**. You can picture neutrons as spinning about their axes like little planets, causing this magnetic moment that will allow the particle to behave as if it is charged. This allows the neutron to behave almost like a bar magnet in the magnetic field.\n",

If the neutron is like a little bar magnet, its movement will depend on whether it is oriented to experience an attractive or repulsive force. \n",

    "\n",
    "However, what happens if we want to *change* the spin of a particle? Remember that quantum objects can be used quantum bits, which are used for quantum computation. \n",
    "For example, two spin states such as $|0\\rangle$ and $|1\\rangle$ can be used as the quantum version of the 1 and 0 bit states used to transmit information in a classical computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You've seen that applying AND, OR, and NOT gates (among others) to classical bits will *change* the infomration contained. There is a way to manipulate quantum information in a similar way, using *quantum gates* as part of a *quantum circuit*. \n",

    "There are three parts of a quantum circuit.\n",

    "- Wires. Wires carry qubits from place to place.\n",

    "2. The H gate, when applied to a normal state, will create a *superposition*: H applied to $|0\\rangle$ will create $\\leftarrow$ and to $|1\\rangle$ will create $\\rightarrow$. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The Z gate is a bit trickier. It does nothing when applied to the $|0\\rangle$ state, but will \"shift\" the $|1\\rangle$ state so that it becomes -$|1\\rangle$. You can see the effect of this on a superposition state, such as $\\leftarrow\\; = |0 \\rangle + |1 \\rangle$. If you apply the Z gate to $\\leftarrow$, you will get $|0 \\rangle - |1 \\rangle$, which is now the $\\rightarrow\\$ state.\n",

Measuring a $\\leftarrow$ or $\\rightarrow$ state in the up-down basis (measuring in terms of $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$ states) will result in a **random** outcome because the left and right states are superpositions of the $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$ states. This is like flipping a coin and having it come either heads or tails at any given time.\n",

    "In the same way, measuring a $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$ state in the left-right basis (measuring in terms of the $\\leftarrow$ or $\\rightarrow$ states) will also have a random outcome, because the $|0\\rangle$ or $|1\\rangle$ states are superpositions of the $\\leftarrow$ and $\\rightarrow$ states.\n",

An 'up' spin is not actually an arrow that points upwards (which is why, when added to a 'down' spin, it makes a 'left' spin and not *nothing*). 'Up' and 'down' are words we used to describe the behavior of spins in the Stern-Gerlach experiment. "

    "\n",
    "Each time you build a circuit that completes a challenge, we'd like you to record your solution into a shared Jamboard. Right now, we'd like one member of the group to make a [Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/) and share the board with the other small group members.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Build a circuit and choose a measurement at the end so that the result of the measurement is random.\n",

    "Hint (2 of 2): Remember from the Stern-Gerlach experiement that an up state going into a left-right magnet gave a random outcome.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Challenge 5\n",
    "You might have noticed that, starting with an \"up\" pointing qubit, an X gate will take you to a \"down\" qubit. But can you do this without ever using an X gate? \n",

    "```{toggle}\n",
    "Remember that the X gate flips the up arrow to a down arrow, and down to up, so the up and down states won't work!\n",

    "\n",
    "Create a state that the Z gate doesn't do anything to. You can use the hints below.\n",

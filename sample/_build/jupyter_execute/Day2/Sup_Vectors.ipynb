    "This requires a bit of math, but if you know what a sphere is and what line is, you should do just fine. Don't let the weird notation fool you. Physicists like to make things fancy by using Greek letters and wacky symbols, but in the end all we are doing is a little geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have learned that qubits can be in any combination of four states. A *state* can refer to anything: it can refer to spin (like we saw in the previous activity) or any other *quantum property* that we find useful. We'll be looking at *spin states* in the next activity, so feel free to think about states that way, if you like.\n",
    "Let's look at the first two of these states, and represent them using a new kind of notation. This will make it easier to deal with them. Don't think too much about the form of the notation, just take it as a given for now.\n",

    "The symbols $|\\;\\rangle$ used to describe the qubits are just a fashionable way of describing simple vectors as given below:\n",

    "If you're not too familiar with the concept of vectors, don't worry! You can imagine a 2-D vector, like the one above, as a set of x and y coordinates. For example, $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ will have x=1, y=0. If you draw a line to this point from the origin, that will be your 'vector'! Vectors are just lines, with one end that is fixed somewhere and another end (the one with the little arrow) free to move about. \n",

    "The quantum states, $|0 \\rangle$ and $|1 \\rangle$ are special vector states called *basis vectors*. What that means is that you can construct any quantum state by a combination (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication by a number) of the  $|0 \\rangle$ and $|1 \\rangle$ states. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the other two states we have seen, $\\leftarrow$ and $\\rightarrow$ can be written as superpositions of the $\\uparrow$ and  $\\downarrow$ states! So these states will contain both  $|0 \\rangle$ and $|1 \\rangle$ in equal amounts.\n",

    "This notation might be a little weird, but it's worth the effort to understand it since most online resources will use this format!\n",
    "$a$ and $b$ are variables that show us how *much* of each basis state exists in the new state. Because the state contains amounts of $|0 \\rangle$ and $|1 \\rangle$, it is said to be in a *superposition* of $|0 \\rangle$ and $|1 \\rangle$ states. Superpositions are a quantum property. This means that when measured, we will get a classical value—either 0 or 1— with a certain probability. \n",

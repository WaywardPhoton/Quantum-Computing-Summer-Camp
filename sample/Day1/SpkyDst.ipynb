    "*A coin is spinning. The coin is in a muddy, wet box resting on the ocean floor in the deepest part of the ocean. It's pitch black. Don't ask who set the coin spinning to begin with, or how it was brought down there —we're physicists, not storytellers! The point of this is that the coin has a twin spinning in an identical box on the surface of a cold, icy planet billions of light years away. Suddenly, the firs coin stops spinning and falls heads up. At the same instant, the second coin, far enough away that it would take light from our planet billions of years to reach it, will come up tails.*\n",
    "\n",
    "How did the second coin 'know' what the first coin would do, and act accordingly? It's clear that no information was communicated, since information cannot travel faster than the speed of light. So what's going on?!\n",

    "This 'spooky action at a distance' baffled Einstein so much that he rejected quantum physics! He thought the whole theory had to be wrong, because things like this just weren't possible.\n",

    "Particles that know each other's state instantly in this way are said to be entangled.  Entangled particles are very useful for quantum computers because the outcomes of their measurements are *correlated*. The entangled coins in the example above will always stop spinning (be measured) with their opposite sides facing up.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to particles in quantum circuits, a transformation that is applied to one particle in the set also indirectly affects the other particle, even if it is nowhere near the first particle physically. There are some really cool things that can be done because of this! \n",

    "**Quantum teleportation** is a way to move quantum states around in the absence of a quantum channel linking the sender of the quantum state and the recipient. Let's do a little experiment. Consider two friends in the near future, Alice and Bob. Alice lives on Earth, but Bob lives in a colony on Mars. Alice has a quantum state, called **A** , that she wants to send to Bob. However, an inter-planetary quantum channel for sending quantum states from one place to another doesn't yet exist. Alice can only use classical information —ones and zeros—to transport her state. This seems like a pretty tough situation!\n",

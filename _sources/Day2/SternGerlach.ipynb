Putting the magnet in the vertical position lets you measure if the spin would go up or down (a measurement in the $|0\\rangle$ , $|1\\rangle$, frame of reference or *basis*). Putting the magnet in the horizontal position lets you check if the spin would go left or right (a measurement in the $\\leftarrow\\;$, $\\rightarrow\\;$ frame of reference or basis). \n",

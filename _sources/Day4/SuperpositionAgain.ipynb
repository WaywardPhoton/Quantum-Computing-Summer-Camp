Remember that superposition is when one state is made out of other ones. Let's look at these states, and their notation, again: \n",

    "To look at this in a qualitative way let's look at sound waves and noise cancellation. The way your noise cancelling headphone work is by using the principle of superposition in a classical way. Let's say you have an incoming sound wave that has the a noise signal on top of it. Interference is used reduce the amplitude of unwanted noise: your headphone will generate a tone of approximately the same frequency and amplitude, but out of phase by a value of $\\pi$ or 180 degrees:\n",

    "![](images/noise.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see above, the *superposition* of the noise signal with the generated signal will result in *interference*, which reduce the amplitude of the incoming noise signal. The noise signal does not dissapear entirely because the amplitude and phase of the generated signal is not a perfect match: but it does the job well enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "A quantum computer works much the same way. At the start of most algorithms, all the qubits are put into superpositions using H gates. These superpositions will representa all possible computation states. These states are them fed into a quantum circuit that selectively interferes the components of the superposition according the algorithm's design. The magic of the algorithm is that it will interact all the superposition states so that What remains after cancelling the  amplitudes and phases of the input state is the solution to the computation!\n",

    "Entangled states are also very useful in quantum computing. Entangled states, as we have seen, have the unique property where the combined state of the qubits contains more information than the qubits do individually. Many qubits can be entangled, and these states can be used for quantum teleportation (which we've explored), where an entangled state is used to transfer information from one qubit to another regardless of physical distance.  \n"

    "Now that we've explored measurement as part of some simple simulations, it's time to take a look at some interesting circuits that can be build and run on a real quantum computer! Go ahead and download the Jupyter notebook for this exercise and then open it inside the IBMQ experience quantum lab.\n",

    "Let's do a little thought experiment with our good friends Alice and Bob. They still haven't mastered interplanetary communication!\n",
    "\n",
    "The new communications channel set up by NASA on Mars is still in its testing phases, and so its capacity is limited. Since Alice and Bob still share an entangled state (each has one of the two entangled qubits), Alice wonders if it is possible to send multiple bits of classical information to Bob using just her half of the state and some quantum gates. This way, she can avoid overloading the channel and share as much information with Bob as she likes!\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens is that Alice will apply a specific quantum gate to her qubit (corresponding to the information she wants to send) and then send her half of the entangled state to Bob. Bob will measure both his and Alice's qubits, and determine the two bits of information that Alice wanted to send to him. It seems as if Alice has 'sent' two bits of information through a single qubit! This is why this is called **superdense coding**.\n",

    "This circuit illustrates something fundamentally important about quantum information: a resource (our entangled state) created at an earlier time with no purpose in mind can be used at a later date to transmit information. The entangled particles haven't seen each other since they were created, and yet they can be used to share this information. That's wild!\n",

    "The first of these states $|00\\rangle$ corresponds to both particles being in the 0 state and the second, $11\\rangle$ to both of them being in the state. All this means is that the two qubits, *q0* and *q1* are either both 0 or both 1 when measured. There is a 50% chance that the first qubit will be measured as either 0 or 1, and a 100% chance of getting the same measurement for the second qubit. The outcome of a measurement on this type of entangled state, called a Bell state, will always be correlated. You might remember this from the section on entanglement. \n",

It's beyond the scope of this activity to determine exactly which gates need to be used, so a function called **encode_message** has already been written for this purpose. Base on the value in the string *message*, this function will apply the necessary gates to Alice's part of the entangled state.
